Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 10.10.0.2:8443 --token ub1l2b.41mrz8vraceo752u \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2384e892da516917c7c8b540fbd7b815085fe255937cf830d7c5064a67c6be40 \
        --control-plane --certificate-key f9df72506757d944ca5e521010f625ca4b75f5ee299b9cc3198a36ae2b895e77

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.10.0.2:8443 --token ub1l2b.41mrz8vraceo752u \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:2384e892da516917c7c8b540fbd7b815085fe255937cf830d7c5064a67c6be40
